This utility has a storied story.
While trying sql-Mode in Emacs, I changed the configuration to use sqlcmd instead of osql and I ran into a number of problems (the Emacs Wiki has a lot of details on this). I figured I could create my own tool to mimic the basic functionality of the real sqlcmd and make it play nice with comint and understand what was the issue.
After a first attempt in .NET, I ended up back in Pythonland where everything is solved so much easier :) And since the test tool ended up working well enough, I added a few useful commands and here we are.

This small source file can be compiled with PyInstaller. Uses f-strings, so it requires Python 3.6.

TODO:

-Add support for User/Pass logins, right now it assumed integrated security.
-Command "parsing" (quotes because there isn't really parsing) is really fickle.
-Ditto for command line arguments "parsing".
-Since it uses ODBC, it should be really easy to connect to other databases. In that case the hardcoded command queries could be moved to a config file for each engine etc. Not interested in that right now, but it can be done.

Currenly this works good enough and it fulfills its mission of making MSSQL and sql-mode play nice together.
