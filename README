Drop in replacement for sqlcmd that works better with Sql-Mode in Emacs.
This implements only a subset of the options in sqlcmd, but more than enough for SQLi buffers.

The source file can be compiled with PyInstaller. Uses f-strings, so it requires Python 3.6.

TODO:

-Command "parsing" (quotes because there isn't really parsing) is really fickle.
-Since it uses ODBC, it should be really easy to connect to other databases. In that case the hardcoded command queries could be moved to a config file for each engine etc. Not interested in that right now, but it can be done.

Currently this works good enough and it fulfills its mission of making MSSQL and sql-mode play nice together.
